Git 2.8 Release Notes
=====================

Updates since v2.7
------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * "branch --delete" has "branch -d" but "push --delete" does not.

 * "git blame" learned to produce the progress eye-candy when it takes
   too much time before emitting the first line of the result.

 * "git grep" can now be configured (or told from the command line)
   how many threads to use when searching in the working tree files.

 * Some "git notes" operations, e.g. "git log --notes=<note>", should
   be able to read notes from any tree-ish that is shaped like a notes
   tree, but the notes infrastructure required that the argument must
   be a ref under refs/notes/.  Loosen it to require a valid ref only
   when the operation would update the notes (in which case we must
   have a place to store the updated notes tree, iow, a ref).

 * "git grep" by default does not fall back to its "--no-index"
   behaviour outside a directory under Git's control (otherwise the
   user may by mistake end up running a huge recursive search); with a
   new configuration (set in $HOME/.gitconfig--by definition this
   cannot be set in the config file per project), this safety can be
   disabled.

 * "git pull --rebase" has been extended to allow invoking
   "rebase -i".

 * "git p4" learned to cope with the type of a file getting changed.

 * "git format-patch" learned to notice format.outputDirectory
   configuration variable.  This allows "-o <dir>" option to be
   omitted on the command line if you always use the same directory in
   your workflow.

 * "interpret-trailers" has been taught to optionally update a file in
   place, instead of always writing the result to the standard output.

 * Many commands that read files that are expected to contain text
   that is generated (or can be edited) by the end user to control
   their behaviour (e.g. "git grep -f <filename>") have been updated
   to be more tolerant to lines that are terminated with CRLF (they
   used to treat such a line to contain payload that ends with CR,
   which is usually not what the users expect).

 * "git notes merge" used to limit the source of the merged notes tree
   to somewhere under refs/notes/ hierarchy, which was too limiting
   when inventing a workflow to exchange notes with remote
   repositories using remote-tracking notes trees (located in e.g.
   refs/remote-notes/ or somesuch).

 * "git ls-files" learned a new "--eol" option to help diagnose
   end-of-line problems.

 * "ls-remote" learned an option to show which branch the remote
   repository advertises as its primary by pointing its HEAD at.

 * New http.proxyAuthMethod configuration variable can be used to
   specify what authentication method to use, as a way to work around
   proxies that do not give error response expected by libcurl when
   CURLAUTH_ANY is used.  Also, the codepath for proxy authentication
   has been taught to use credential API to store the authentication
   material in user's keyrings.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Add a framework to spawn a group of processes in parallel, and use
   it to run "git fetch --recurse-submodules" in parallel.

 * A slight update to the Makefile to mark "phoney" targets
   as such correctly.

 * In-core storage of the reverse index for .pack files (which lets
   you go from a pack offset to an object name) has been streamlined.

 * d95138e6 (setup: set env $GIT_WORK_TREE when work tree is set, like
   $GIT_DIR, 2015-06-26) attempted to work around a glitch in alias
   handling by overwriting GIT_WORK_TREE environment variable to
   affect subprocesses when set_git_work_tree() gets called, which
   resulted in a rather unpleasant regression to "clone" and "init".
   Try to address the same issue by always restoring the environment
   and respawning the real underlying command when handling alias.

 * The low-level code that is used to create symbolic references has
   been updated to share more code with the code that deals with
   normal references.

 * strbuf_getline() and friends have been redefined to make it easier
   to identify which callsite of (new) strbuf_getline_lf() should
   allow and silently ignore carriage-return at the end of the line to
   help users on DOSsy systems.

 * "git shortlog" used to accumulate various pieces of information
   regardless of what was asked to be shown in the final output.  It
   has been optimized by noticing what need not to be collected
   (e.g. there is no need to collect the log messages when showing
   only the number of changes).

 * "git checkout $branch" (and other operations that share the same
   underlying machinery) has been optimized.

 * Automated tests in Travis CI environment has been optimized by
   persisting runtime statistics of previous "prove" run, executing
   tests that take longer before other ones; this reduces the total
   wallclock time.


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v2.7
----------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v2.7 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases'
notes for details).

 * An earlier change in 2.5.x-era broke users' hooks and aliases by
   exporting GIT_WORK_TREE to point at the root of the working tree,
   interfering when they tried to use a different working tree without
   setting GIT_WORK_TREE environment themselves.
   (merge df1e6ea nd/stop-setenv-work-tree later to maint).

 * The "exclude_list" structure has the usual "alloc, nr" pair of
   fields to be used by ALLOC_GROW(), but clear_exclude_list() forgot
   to reset 'alloc' to 0 when it cleared 'nr' to discard the managed
   array.
   (merge 2653a8c nd/dir-exclude-cleanup later to maint).

 * Paths that have been told the index about with "add -N" are not
   quite yet in the index, but a few commands behaved as if they
   already are in a harmful way.
   (merge 4d55200 nd/ita-cleanup later to maint).

 * "git send-email" was confused by escaped quotes stored in the alias
   files saved by "mutt", which has been corrected.
   (merge 2c510f2 ew/send-email-mutt-alias-fix later to maint).

 * A few unportable C construct have been spotted by clang compiler
   and have been fixed.
   (merge a0df2e5 jk/clang-pedantic later to maint).

 * The documentation has been updated to hint the connection between
   the '--signoff' option and DCO.
   (merge b2c150d dw/signoff-doc later to maint).

 * "git reflog" incorrectly assumed that all objects that used to be
   at the tip of a ref must be commits, which caused it to segfault.
   (merge aecad37 dk/reflog-walk-with-non-commit later to maint).

 * The ignore mechanism saw a few regressions around untracked file
   listing and sparse checkout selection areas in 2.7.0; the change
   that is responsible for the regression has been reverted.
   (merge 8c72236 nd/exclusion-regression-fix later to maint).

 * Some codepaths used fopen(3) when opening a fixed path in $GIT_DIR
   (e.g. COMMIT_EDITMSG) that is meant to be left after the command is
   done.  This however did not work well if the repository is set to
   be shared with core.sharedRepository and the umask of the previous
   user is tighter.  They have been made to work better by calling
   unlink(2) and retrying after fopen(3) fails with EPERM.
   (merge ea56518 js/fopen-harder later to maint).

 * Asking gitweb for a nonexistent commit left a warning in the server
   log.

   Somebody may want to follow this up with an additional test, perhaps?
   IIRC, we do test that no Perl warnings are given to the server log,
   so this should have been caught if our test coverage were good.
   (merge a9eb90a ho/gitweb-squelch-undef-warning later to maint).

 * "git rebase", unlike all other callers of "gc --auto", did not
   ignore the exit code from "gc --auto".
   (merge 8c24f5b jk/ok-to-fail-gc-auto-in-rebase later to maint).

 * Many codepaths that run "gc --auto" before exiting kept packfiles
   mapped and left the file descriptors to them open, which was not
   friendly to systems that cannot remove files that are open.  They
   now close the packs before doing so.
   (merge d562102 js/close-packs-before-gc later to maint).

 * A recent optimization to filter-branch in v2.7.0 introduced a
   regression when --prune-empty filter is used, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge 1dc413e jk/filter-branch-no-index later to maint).

 * The description for SANITY prerequisite the test suite uses has
   been clarified both in the comment and in the implementation.
   (merge 719c3da jk/sanity later to maint).

 * "git tag" started listing a tag "foo" as "tags/foo" when a branch
   named "foo" exists in the same repository; remove this unnecessary
   disambiguation, which is a regression introduced in v2.7.0.
   (merge 0571979 jk/list-tag-2.7-regression later to maint).

 * The way "git svn" uses auth parameter was broken by Subversion
   1.9.0 and later.
   (merge 0b66415 ew/svn-1.9.0-auth later to maint).

 * The "split" subcommand of "git subtree" (in contrib/) incorrectly
   skipped merges when it shouldn't, which was corrected.
   (merge 933cfeb dw/subtree-split-do-not-drop-merge later to maint).

 * A few options of "git diff" did not work well when the command was
   run from a subdirectory.
   (merge a97262c nd/diff-with-path-params later to maint).

 * The command line completion learned a handful of additional options
   and command specific syntax.
   (merge fa4b5e3 jk/completion-rebase later to maint).
   (merge f7c2e1a pw/completion-show-branch later to maint).
   (merge d7d4ca8 pw/completion-stash later to maint).
   (merge e6414b4 tb/complete-word-diff-regex later to maint).

 * dirname() emulation has been added, as Msys2 lacks it.
   (merge e7d5ce8 js/dirname-basename later to maint).

 * The underlying machinery used by "ls-files -o" and other commands
   have been taught not to create empty submodule ref cache for a
   directory that is not a submodule.  This removes a ton of wasted
   CPU cycles.
   (merge a2d5156 jk/ref-cache-non-repository-optim later to maint).

 * Other minor clean-ups and documentation updates
   (merge 99487cf ss/user-manual later to maint).
   (merge e914ef0 ew/for-each-ref-doc later to maint).
   (merge 36fc7d8 sg/t6050-failing-editor-test-fix later to maint).
   (merge 60253a6 ss/clone-depth-single-doc later to maint).
   (merge bd02e97 lv/add-doc-working-tree later to maint).
